# egui_glfw_callback

## Why this fork?

We all know, `egui_glfw` is now archived, And you can not add it to the latest version of a glfw project. Here all of that is fixed, you can just install at and everything is ready to go!

## Added
Added callback painting. For easy rendering inside a Widget.
